As a consequence the number and composition of the labour force differs. Firstly, for the Dutch national definition a twelve hours threshold is used for the number of hours a person works or wants to work per week. For the international definition this is not the case.\r\nSecondly, the unemployed labour force is defined differently. According to the international definition someone has to be available to start working within two weeks. For the Dutch national definition a term of three months within which a person can start working or started to search for work, is used for specific cases. Lastly, also the age definition deviates.\r\n",
